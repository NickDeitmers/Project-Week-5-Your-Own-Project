## Project Description
Project checks the relationship between the average temperature per country per year with a few variables.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Questions
Is there a correlation between average temperature and:
1.	The suicide rate (number of suicides per 100k people)?
2.	The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (in $)?
3.	The Human Development Index (HDI)?
4.	The military expenses (as % of GDP)?
Hypotheses
1.	The suicide rate in warm countries differs from the suicide rate in cold countries.
2.	The GDP per capita in warm countries differs from the GDP per capita in cold countries.
3.	The HDI in warm countries differs from the HDI in cold countries.
4.	The military expenses in warm countries differs from the military expenses in cold countries.


## Dataset
Data was retrieved from two different sources from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and from Worldbank Data (https://data.worldbank.org/). The data was merged into one data frame, which contained information about all of the topics during the period of 1997 â€“ 2013.  Some countries were not considered in the study due to the lack of data.

## Workflow
1.	List of interesting topics
2.	Research of valuable and reliable data to use for each topic
3.	Selecting a definitive topic, create Questions and Hypotheses
4.	Download and clean datasets and necessary related information
5.	Understand relations between different data values along the years and find correlations between different data
6.	Creating plots to visualize and make understanding easier
7.	Testing hypotheses and answering questions
8.	Producing a presentation for the results
